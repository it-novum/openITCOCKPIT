# ARCHIVE AGE CONFIGURATION

# NOTICE:
# The Statusengine Database cleanup cronjob should only run at one node of your cluster
# You can run the cron on as many nodes as you want, but this will increase the load of the system.
# If you want to run the cronjob on more than one node, you should set different times for scheduling the cron
# For example at 01:00AM on node1 and at 01:00PM on node2 or so
# Cronjob usage:
# bin/Console.php cleanup -q (will run the cronjob without any output, perfect for crontab)
#
# bin/Console.php cleanup (will run the cronjob with output, perfect to check whats going on)

# For some perfdata backends, Statusengine is able to cleanup the database:
