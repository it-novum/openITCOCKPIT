# Set this to 'no' if you want Mod-Gearman to only take care of
# servicechecks. No hostchecks will be processed by Mod-Gearman. Use
# this option to disable hostchecks and still have the possibility to

{% else %}
localservicegroups={{ localservicegroups }}
{% endif %}

# The queue_custom_variable can be used to define the target queue
# by a custom variable in addition to host/servicegroups. When set
# for ex. to 'WORKER' you then could define a '_WORKER' custom
# variable for your hosts and services to directly set the worker
# queue. The host queue is inherited unless overwritten
# by a service custom variable. Set the value of your custom
# variable to 'local' to bypass Mod-Gearman (Same behaviour as in
# localhostgroups/localservicegroups).
queue_custom_variable=WORKER

# Enable or disable result worker thread. The default is one, but
# you can set it to zero to disabled result workers, for example
# if you only want to export performance data.
# Default: 1
result_workers={{ result_workers }}


# defines if the module should distribute perfdata
# to gearman.
# Note: processing of perfdata is not part of
# mod_gearman. You will need additional worker for
# handling performance data, like ex. pnp4nagios.
# Performance data is just written to the gearman
# queue and not further processed.
# You can specify multiple queues by comma separated list.
# Default: no
perfdata={{ export_perfdata }}

# Set perfdata_send_all=yes to submit all performance data
# of all hosts and services regardless of if they
# have 'process_performance_data' enabled or not.
# Default: no
perfdata_send_all=no

# perfdata mode overwrite helps preventing the perdata queue getting to big
# 1 = overwrote
# 2 = append
perfdata_mode=1

# The Mod-Gearman NEB module will submit a fake result for orphaned host
# checks with a message saying there is no worker running for this
# queue. Use this option to get better reporting results, otherwise your
# hosts will keep their last state as long as there is no worker
# running.
# Default: yes
orphan_host_checks=yes

# Same like 'orphan_host_checks' but for services.
# Default: yes
orphan_service_checks=yes

# Set return code of orphaned checks.
# 0 = OK
# 1 = WARNING
# 2 = CRITICAL
# 3 = UNKNOWN
orphan_return={{ orphaned_checks_returncode }}

# When accept_clear_results is enabled, the NEB module will accept unencrypted
# results too. This is quite useful if you have lots of passive checks and make
# use of send_gearman/send_multi where you would have to spread the shared key to
# all clients using these tools.
# Default is no.
accept_clear_results=no

# When latency_flatten_window is enabled, the module reschedules host/service checks
# if their latency is more than one second. This value is the maximum delay in
# seconds applied to hosts/services. Set to 0 or less than 0 to disable rescheduling.
# Default is 30.
latency_flatten_window=30

# Gearman connection timeout(in milliseconds) while submitting jobs to
# gearmand server
# Default is -1(no timeout)
