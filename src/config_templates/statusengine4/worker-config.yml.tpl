# Every key below is optional - omit anything you don't want to override.
# Precedence, for every setting, is:
#
#   explicit CLI flag  >  environment variable  >  this file  >  built-in default
#
# So this file is the place for your "boring", rarely-changing settings,
# while flags/environment variables (handy in Docker/CI) can still
# override anything here for a one-off run without editing the file.
#
# All values below are shown with their built-in default.

# Queue backend to consume from: "gearman" or "rabbitmq".
consumer: gearman

# Gearman job server address (host:port). Only used when consumer: gearman.
gearman_addr: 127.0.0.1:4730

# Maximum number of Gearman job handlers running at once, PER QUEUE. This
# is not a throughput knob: the library dispatches every assigned job on
# its own goroutine and grabs the next without waiting, and a handler
# blocks on MySQL once a bulk-insert buffer is full. Without a cap, a
# backlog accumulates inside the worker (one goroutine plus a decoded
# payload per job) instead of staying queued at the job server.
#
# Per queue, because the worker opens one Gearman connection per queue and
# each has a Work loop of its own. A shared budget is a budget that one
# backlogged queue takes all of - and since that loop stops reading its
# socket once the budget is gone, every other queue stops being served
# entirely, not merely slowly. The process-wide worst case is therefore
# this value times the number of queues (12), so 8 here is 96 overall. An
# idle queue costs nothing; a cap only binds when there is traffic.
#
# Must be >= 1. NOTE: this replaces the old `gearman_max_concurrent_jobs`,
# which was a single budget shared by all queues. The worker refuses to
# start if that key is still present rather than reinterpreting its value,
# because carrying a 64 over would mean 768 concurrent handlers here.
gearman_max_concurrent_jobs_per_queue: {{gearman_max_concurrent_jobs_per_queue}}

# RabbitMQ broker URL (amqp://user:pass@host:port/vhost). Only used when
# consumer: rabbitmq.
rabbitmq_url: amqp://statusengine:statusengine@127.0.0.1:5672/

# Maximum unacknowledged deliveries the broker may push, per queue. The
# RabbitMQ counterpart of gearman_max_concurrent_jobs_per_queue: without it AMQP
# delivers as fast as it can and the whole backlog ends up buffered in
# this process. Applies per queue, so the worst case in memory is this
# value times the number of queues (currently 12). Must be >= 1.
rabbitmq_prefetch: 100

# MySQL data source name (go-sql-driver/mysql format).
mysql_dsn: {{mysql_user}}:{{mysql_password}}@tcp({{mysql_host}}:3306)/{{mysql_database}}?parseTime=true

# Maximum number of open MySQL connections, also used as the idle-connection
# limit so the pool doesn't tear down and redial connections between the
# bulk-inserters' 250ms flush ticks. Keep this below the server's
# max_connections, and remember it applies per worker process.
mysql_max_open_conns: {{mysql_max_open_conns}}

# Rows buffered per table before a bulk INSERT is flushed ahead of the
# 250ms ticker. The default of 100 is conservative; 700 is the documented
# production value and also the maximum.
#
# The ceiling is not a matter of taste. Every flush is sent as a server-side
# prepared statement, and those are limited to 65535 placeholders. What has
# to fit is not this number of rows but roughly twice it: on a shutdown or
# core-restart flush the buffer is topped up with whatever is still in
# flight, and all of it becomes one statement. At 700 the widest table
# (statusengine_servicestatus, 43 columns) needs 1399 x 43 = 60157 of the
# 65535 - with room for three more columns. At 1000 it would need 85957 and
# fail with "Error 1390: Prepared statement contains too many placeholders",
# which is deterministic, therefore never retried, and would drop every
# batch: the two status tables would silently stop being written.
#
# Raising this only matters under sustained load. With a 250ms ticker a
# batch size of N only binds above roughly 4*N events per second on that one
# table - 100 caps at ~400 rows/s per table, 700 at ~2800. Note also that a
# failed flush drops its batch, so this is equally the number of events one
# bad row can take down with it.
mysql_batch_size: {{number_of_bulk_records}}

# Metrics buffered before a Graphite Carbon write is flushed ahead of the
# 250ms ticker. Default 100, maximum 1000, which is also the documented
# production value.
#
# Higher than the MySQL ceiling because nothing in the protocol limits it: a
# batch is one Write of newline-delimited plaintext lines. The cap is purely
# about loss - a failed dial or write drops the entire buffered batch and
# leaves re-dialling to the next flush, and Graphite metrics have no
# redelivery behind them.

#

#
# These two queues carry a full snapshot of an object's current state, sent
# again on every check and overwriting its predecessor in a single-row-per-

# While the worker is down they pile up one job per check interval per
# object, and draining that backlog costs the same MySQL time live traffic
# needs, which the live traffic then waits for. Skipping it lets the worker
# catch up in seconds instead of minutes.
#
# Applies to those two queues ONLY. Every other queue carries history -
# check results, state changes, notifications - where each event is the
# single record of something that happened and age is no reason to drop it.
#
# Any Go duration ("5m", "90s", "1h"). "0" processes every event regardless
# of age. Note the comparison is between the monitoring core's clock and
# this worker's: if the two hosts disagree by more than this, both queues
# stop being written entirely. statusengine_queue_events_discarded_stale_total

# line per bulk-insert flush, which was measured at ~145 MB of journal per
# hour under sustained load. Use "debug" to explain a specific flush, not to
# watch a healthy worker. Errors are logged at every occurrence regardless of

# DATA RETENTION (cmd/db_cleanup only)
#
# Everything below is read by the cleanup tool, not by the worker - the
# worker ignores these keys, just as the cleanup tool ignores everything
# above except mysql_dsn, log_level and log_format. Both binaries share
# this one file:
#
#   go run ./cmd/db_cleanup -config /path/to/config.yaml
#
# Run it from cron or a systemd timer, once a day is plenty. In a cluster,
# run it on exactly one node - or on several at clearly different times.
#
# Every value is a number of DAYS of history to keep, configured
# separately for hosts and services. The key names are the ones the legacy
# PHP worker uses, so an existing config.yml can be carried over value for
# value - including its convention:
#
#   0 disables cleanup of that table entirely.
#
# A missing key falls back to the built-in default shown here; only an
# explicit 0 switches a table off.
