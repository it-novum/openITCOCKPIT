## What is the statusmap in openITCOCKPIT v3?

The statusmap is meant to show a visual overview over all hosts monitored by the system.

## How to use the statusmap?

You can zoom into the map by clicking on a host. This also shows detailed information of the host and its services in an information window.
To reset the zoomlevel simply doubleclick anywhere inside the map. You can move the map by pressing the left mouse button and holding it while moving the mouse.

You can search for hosts via the hostname in the topleft corner.
