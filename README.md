# System requirements

* Ubuntu LTS or Debian
* 2 CPU cores (x86-64)
* 2 GB RAM
* 40 GB space

### Production system sizing

Unfortunately there is no golden rule for the right sizing of a monitoring system. This depends on the amount of hosts
and services you like to monitor.

Please keep in mind that a monitoring system usually will create more I/O than your KVM farm!

It's recommended to use SSD as main storage.

A rough guide:

* 32 GB RAM
* 16 CPU Cores
* 500 GB space
